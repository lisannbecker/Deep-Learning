**Image Classifier NN (Numpy):**  Implements an image classifier using only NumPy, without relying on standard deep learning libraries like PyTorch.<br>
This approach involves manually constructing a neural network architecture and mathematical operations, explicitly showcasing underlying ML algorithms and linear algebra operations.

**Image Classifier NN (PyTorch):** Tackles the same image classification task using the PyTorch library.<br>
This project demonstrates how to leverage PyTorch's high-level abstractions and built-in functions to efficiently construct, train, and evaluate neural network models. 
By utilizing PyTorch, this complementary project highlights the benefits of automatic differentiation and model optimization, providing a contrast to the manual implementations of the NumPy-based classifier.
