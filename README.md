## Contents

### Image Classifier NN (NumPy)
Implements an image classifier using only NumPy, without relying on standard deep learning libraries like PyTorch.<br>
This approach involves manually constructing a neural network architecture and mathematical operations, explicitly showcasing underlying linear algebra operations.
<br><br><br>

### Image Classifier NN (PyTorch)
Tackles the same image classification task using the PyTorch library.<br>
This project demonstrates how to leverage PyTorch's high-level functions to efficiently construct, train, and evaluate neural network models. 
By utilizing PyTorch, this project provides a contrast to the manual implementations of the NumPy-based classifier.
